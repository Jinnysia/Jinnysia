## Hi there! ðŸ˜Š

My name is Jinnysia (or Josh) and I have a deep-seated love for programming and everything about it. Nice to meet you!

I love learning about technology and using what I've learned to make applications for practical use or for entertainment. I'm also a huge nerd.

My favorite language is **C#** and I use it for most of my aplications. I also enjoy using PHP, MySQL/PostgreSQL, and C++.

I'm currently learning **Java** in classes, and I'm experimenting with **Python** and **C** on the side, too.

### Sublime Dice
I'm currently working on **SublimeDice** which is a virtual dice rolling game. It presents a pretty interface for end-users using .NET's WinForms, and communicates with a MySQL server on the Internet.

### CL-211
A vast Alternate Reality Game (ARG) with a captivating story, CL-211 is a tribute to Cicada 3301, a set of three very substantial puzzles that required extensive knowledge on topics such as cryptography and steganography.
